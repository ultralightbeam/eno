"Project Eno: List of actions that amplify a sense of prsence / here-now, build better thought bridges between the consciousness and unconsciousness"
Do things at different speeds.
Think about death. Feel the urgency.
Look at an object. Focus on its edges. Then view it holistically.
Do one really boring thing.
Take a walk.
Work on something with intense focus. Then take deep rest.
Consciously stay in good posture.
Think of one new thing you are grateful for.
Take an object. Close your eyes. Feel the object and reconstruct its form as accurately as possible.
Clean up your work space.
Listen to a song and focus on it without doing anything else.
